					<div class="collapsible-header active"><i class="tiny mdi-action-event left"></i>Day 1: Get started with basics!</div>
					<div class="collapsible-body"><p>In this workshop, Participants tinker with basic electronic components. 
					Peek inside and learn from simple projects and programming code examples, and tweak them to make your own. 
					Practice soldering to create strong electrical connections. Collaborate to prototype and create original projects that dazzle the senses and respond to the “real world” via light, sound and/or motion. 
					Participants learn about The Maker Movement, Maker Learning And It's Potential Impact On Education. Our lives are mediated by digital devices and technology. 
					By learning to program, you take control of this! Participants who know how to program know how to speak the language behind our digital society. 
					This leads to a shift from being a consumer of technology to a creator of technology.</p></div>

					<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="tiny mdi-action-event left"></i>Day 2: 3-D Printing</div>
					<div class="collapsible-body"><p>In this workshop, participants will be given an introduction to 3D printing, history and applications of 3D printing technology. This will be a hands-on and interactive exercise  where participants will go through downloading 3D designs, creating their own designs, converting their 3D design files to a format that the 3D printer can recognize and print,
					and uploading and printing their designs using the 3D printer.</p></div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="tiny mdi-action-event left"></i>Day 3: Arduino</div>
					<div class="collapsible-body"><p>Arduino is an electronics prototyping platform that helps you control real-world objects with software and computers. 
					With Arduino you can build games, security systems, musical instruments, robots, and much more. In this workshop participants will be given an introduction to programming. They will then apply their new knowledge to an Arduino controlled make. The workshop will be hands-on and interactive. By the end of the course the participants will have understanding of various sensors, a functioning make that follows the program they wrote for it.
					With this understanding the participants can use Arduino in the future to create inventions and design new toys and robots.
					<br />Arduino is a micro-controntroller, a small computer used as the brain of the robot which can be programmed to control the way buttons, motors, switches, sensors, lights, 
					and other electronic parts interact.</p></div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="tiny mdi-action-event left"></i>Day 4: Minecraft: Raspberry Pi Edition</div>
					<div class="collapsible-body"><p>Minecraft: Raspberry Pi Edition is a teaching and learning tool we’ve found absolutely invaluable. It’s a powerful way to get participants who didn’t realise they had an aptitude for programming excited about the Pi; it’s a creative, constructive tool; participants and teachers love it; and we find it’s enormously popular with participants all over the world.<br />
					A Raspberry Pi is a hand-sized computer you can use to do all sorts of projects. Plus you can buy colorful cases, even build a case from Legos. In this workshop, participants will learn to setup and run Minecraft on Raspberry Pi. During the process recognize that a range of digital devices can be considered to be a computer. Recognize and can use a range of input and output devices. Understand the hardware and software components that make up computer systems, and how they communicate with one another and with other systems.
					Recognize and understand the function of the main internal parts of basic computer architecture.
					</p></div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="tiny mdi-action-event left"></i>Day 5: Robotics</div>
					<div class="collapsible-body"><p> Robotics participants will design, plan, program, and build a functioning robot while using an Arduino and learning how to code. <br/>An Arduino is a micro-controntroller, a small computer used as the brain of the robot which can be programmed to control the way buttons, motors, switches, sensors, lights, and other electronic parts interact. By the end of this program participants will have learned about many of the cool ways computers and coding are everywhere in their life, and how to plan and build their own amazing devices. <br/>
					These skills are highly transferable, as participants learn in an open-ended, exploratory way how to do computer programming and use electronics. They then go on to create more complex robots and more.
